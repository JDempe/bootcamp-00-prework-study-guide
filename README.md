# UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp Prework Study Guide

## Description

The UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp Prework Study Guide (henceforth referred to as simply as the Prework Study Guide) provides a list of helpful tips, reminders, and links for each of the four tools/languages used during the prework.  The topics covered are HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

The Prework Study Guide was created to provide a single repository of information for important skills learned during the process of creating the webpage.  It also provided a first-step into each of the technologies, as all four were used during the creation of the webpage!
